_Oliebollen_, fried eggy donuts, are traditionally served in the
Netherlands around New Year's Eve.  _Gelukkig nieuwjaar!_

## Materials

- milk (500 ml)
- yeast (1.5 tsp)
- sugar (2 tbsp)
- all purpose flour (500 g)
- salt (0.5 tsp)
- egg (1)
- oil (excess)

## Procedure

1. Microwave milk until lukewarm.  Stir in yeast and sugar, and set
   aside.
2. Sift flour into a large mixing bowl.  Carefully pour in the milk
   and gently mix with a rubber spatula.
3. Crack an egg into the bowl and gently mix again.  Cover the bowl
   with foil or plastic and set aside for an hour.
4. Heat oil in a small saucepan to 320-350F.
5. Dip two metal spoons in the oil to prevent batter from sticking.
   Using a scooping motion, form a small pillow of dough and gently
   drop it into the oil.
6. Fry until golden brown, turn occasionally.  Serve with finishing
   sugar.
