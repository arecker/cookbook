# Paella

This paella recipe is a Chef John classic.  Traditional paella is made
with a special paella dish, but I find that it works just as well with
a large cast iron skillet (but any heavy bottom, shallow, oven safe
pan should do).  Take the following ingredients only as a
recommendation, as it pretty much works with any vegetables you have
at your disposal.  Apart from the rice and broth, the quantities
listed here are very flexible, so just use whatever you know will fit
in your trusty skillet.

## Materials

- raw shrimp, shells set aside (1 lb)
- chicken broth (3 cups)
- saffron (3-4 threads)[^2]
- olive oil (ex)
- sausage, diced (8 oz)
- pancetta, cubed (8 oz)
- yellow onion, diced (1/2)
- garlic, sliced (4 cloves)
- green bell pepper, diced
- red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- white rice, medium grain (2 cups)
- paprika (ex)
- dried oregano (ex)
- dried rosemary (ex)
- tomato paste (1 tbsp)
- salt (ex)
- olive oil (ex)

## Procedure

1. Sautee the shrimp shells in olive oil until they turn red and smell
   fragrant.  Add the safron and toss.  Add all the chicken broth and
   simmer for twenty minutes.  Strain out the shrimp shells and
   continue to reduce on the side.  You only need 2.5 cups total for
   the rice.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 425F.

3. Add olive oil to a large, flat cast iron pan.  On medium heat, cook
   the sausage and pancetta together until the sausage turns brown and
   the pancetta just turns crispy.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the
   meat into a bowl - leave the fat in the pan.

4. Add diced onion.  Sweat, but do not brown (there should be enough
   fat rendered out of the sausage to prevent browning).

5. Add bell pepper[^1].  Sweat for a few minutes until tender.  Turn
   up the heat if the pan is getting crowded.  Add salt to taste.

6. Add the garlic, along with pepper, paprika, oregano, dried
   rosemary, and tomato paste.  Stir to combine and leave on the heat
   until the spices smell fragrant.

7. Once the garlic starts to soften, add a shot of cognac.  Stir until
   the liquor evaporates, then add the sausage and rice.  Gently
   combine all ing redients in the pan.

8. Add exactly 2.5 cups of the warmed infused chicken broth to the pan
   all at once.  Avoid stirring the mixture from here on out, but give
   it a little shake if you need to level it out.  All the rice should
   be patted flat, under the surface of the liquid.  Turn the heat all
   the way up, and while you wait for the mixture to simmer, arrange
   the shrimp around the top of the dish, pressing them into the rice.

9. Sprinkle thinly sliced red peppers on top of the dish.

10. Once the mixture is simmering (or once you're done arranging the
   shrimp), carefully place in the oven uncovered.  Bake for 20
   minutes.

11. Remove the skillet from the oven and place it back on the stove.
    Cook over medium high heat for 3-5 minutes.  Allow to cool
    for at least 30 minutes before serving.

12. Top with fresh parsley and a glug of olive oil.  Serve with a
    wedge of lemon.  Be sure to include some of the bottom _Socarrat_
    (burnt caramelized bits) on every plate.

[^1]: Also works well with carrots, celery, parsnip, and pretty much
	any other vegetable you have at your disposal.  Just make small
	cuts so they cook quickly and evenly.

[^2]: Sometimes hard to find or a little pricy.  If you're not
    concerned about making something that's authentic, feel free to
    skip this.
