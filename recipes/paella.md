# Paella

This paella recipe is a Chef John classic.  Traditional paella is made
with a special paella dish, but I find that it works just as well with
a large cast iron skillet.  Take the following ingredients only as a
recommendation, as it pretty much works with any vegetables you have
at your disposal.  Apart from the rice and broth, the quantities
listed here are very flexible, so just use whatever you know will fit
in your trusty skillet.

## Materials

- raw shrimp, shells set aside (1 lb)
- chicken broth (2.25 cups)
- saffron (3-4 threads)[^2]
- olive oil (ex)
- sausage, diced (8 oz)
- yellow onion, diced (1/2)
- garlic, minced (2 cloves)
- bell pepper, diced
- white rice, medium grain (1.3 cups)
- paprika (ex)
- salt (ex)

## Procedure

1. Sautee the shrimp shells in olive oil until they turn red and smell
   fragrant.  Add the safron and toss.  Add all the chicken broth and
   simmer for twenty minutes.  Strain out the shrimp shells and set
   aside, keeping it warm in a pan.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 425F.

3. Add olive oil to a large, flat cast iron pan.  Brown the diced
   sausage in medium heat.  Remove the sausage and set aside, but
   leave the fat in the pan.
   
4. Add diced onion.  Sweat, but do not brown (there should be enough
   fat rendered out of the sausage to prevent browning).

5. Add bell pepper[^1].  Sweat for a few minutes until tender.  Turn
   up the heat if the pan is getting crowded.  Add salt to taste.

6. Add the garlic, along with pepper and paprika.  Stir to combine and
   leave on the heat until the spices smell fragrant.  Add the sausage
   back into the pan and mix.  Finally, add all the rice and stir.

7. Add exactly 2 cups of the warmed infused chicken broth to the pan
   all at once.  Avoid stirring the mixture from here on out, but give
   it a little shake if you need to level it out.  All the rice should
   be patted flat, under the surface of the liquid.  Turn the heat all
   the way up, and while you wait for the mixture to simmer, arrange
   the shrimp around the top of the dish, pressing them into the rice.

8. Once the mixture is simmering (or once you're done arranging the
   shrimp), carefully place in the oven uncovered.  Bake for 20
   minutes.

9. Remove the skillet from the oven and place it back on the stove.
   Cook over medium high heat for 3-5 minutes.  Allow to cool.

10. Top with fresh parsley.  Serve with a wedge of lemon.  Be sure to
   include some of the bottom _Socarrat_ (burnt caramelized bits) on
   every plate.

[^1]: Also works well with carrots, celery, parsnip, and pretty much
	any other vegetable you have at your disposal.  Just make small
	cuts so they cook quickly and evenly.
	
[^2]: Sometimes hard to find or a little pricy.  If you're not
    concerned about making something that's authentic, feel free to
    skip this.
