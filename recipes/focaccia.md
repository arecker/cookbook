## Materials

- 1/3 cup warm water (about 110°F)
- teaspoons sugar or honey
- (0.25 ounce) package active-dry yeast
- 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil [^1]
- teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus extra for sprinkling
- sprigs of fresh rosemary [^2]

[^1]: plus more for drizzling (helps if you have one of those drizzler
	bottles) I love Trader Joe’s Spanish olive oil!

[^2]: or any desired herbs, fresh or dried / other toppings

## Procedure

1. In a large bowl (or stand mixer if you want to use the dough
   attachment), mix honey/sugar with the warm water until it
   dissolves. Sprinkle the yeast, give it a quick mix until all the
   particles are wet. Let it get foamy, about 5-10 min.

2. Gradually mix in the flour, olive oil and salt. I mix with a metal
   spoon until it gets thick, then switch to my hands. Knead until
   thoroughly mixed and smooth. (If the dough is too sticky and isn’t
   pulling away from the sides of the bowl, add in an extra 1/4 cup
   flour)

3. Remove dough from the mixing bowl, and use your hands to shape it
   into a ball. Grease the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil or cooking
   spray (so it doesn’t stick), then place the dough ball back in the
   bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Place in a warm location (like
   to set in a warm oven or in a sunny spot) and let the dough rise
   for 45-60 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size.

4. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll/stretch it out into
   a large circle or rectangle until the dough is about 1/2-inch
   thick, or however thick you want it.  Cover the dough again with
   the damp towel, and let the dough continue to rise for another 20
   minutes.

5. Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large
   parchment-covered baking sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch
   baking dish).  Use your fingers to poke deep dents (seriously, poke
   all the way down to the baking sheet) all over the surface of the
   dough.  Drizzle at least 2 tablespoons (preferably more) evenly all
   over the top of the dough. Don’t be stingy, this is where the
   flavor is!

6. Sprinkle evenly with fresh rosemary needles and sea salt, or ANY
   toppings you like. You can press halved cherry tomatoes in, or I
   like to top with thinly sliced red onions or shallots, parmesan,
   and lots of other dried herbs. Pretty much anything you want.

7. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and
   cooked through. You can even lift up the bread to check how brown
   the bottom is getting. Serve!
