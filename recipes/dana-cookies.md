# Dana Cookies

Author: Marissa Recker

This recipe was graciously given to me by my college anatomy professor and mentor Dr. Dana.  The batches are big (3-4 dozen), so please be generous and hand them out to as many friends, neighbors, and classmates as you can.

These cookies are best enjoyed frozen.  Stash whatever you don't give away in a bag in the back of your freezer.

## Materials

- butter, unsalted (3 sticks)
- brown sugar, light (2.25 cups)
- white sugar (1 cup)
- eggs (2)
- vanilla extract (2 tsp)
- water (2 tsp)
- flour, all purpose (2 cups)
- table salt (2 tsp)
- baking soda (1 tsp)
- oatmeal, raw (16 oz or 5.5 cups)
- dark chocolate chips (1 bag or 10 oz)
- butterscotch chips (1 bag or 11 oz)

## Procedure

1. Pre-heat the oven to 350F.

2. Fully melt the butter into a liquid.  Combine the melted butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and cream together in a mixer until fluffy.

3. While mixing, slowly add the eggs one at a time.  Add vanilla extract and water.  Continue mixing until the ingredients form an even paste.

4. In a separate, large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda.  Whisk ingredients together.  Now add the wet paste from the mixer.  Gently stir with a rubber spatula, but do not completely mix.[^1]

5. Add all the oatmeal, dark chocolate chips, and butterscotch.  Set the spatula aside and finish mixing with hands.

6. Lightly grease a large sheet pan.  Using an ice-cream scooper, scoop portions of the batter onto the pan about 1.5 inches apart.

7. Bake[^2] the cookies on the middle rack for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.  Take them out of the oven and allow them to finish baking on the hot pan for another 10 minutes or until they harden.

8. Use a spatula to gently remove them from the pan.  Cookies will be gooey until they are cooled.

[^1]: the cookies will turn out too chewy if you over-mix, so mix as little as possible.  For this reason, it's recommended to do the final mixing with hands.
[^2]: use convection if availble, otherwise the cookies will still turn out fine
