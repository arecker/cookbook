# Amstel Bread

I proudly offer my recipe for Amstel bread - reliable, consistent, and
low maintenance - it's like the M16 of dinner sides.  It makes a small
loaf that serves about 4-5 people, and it's incredibly easy to throw
together.  No kneading required and very conservative with yeast.

I usually throw it together around 11 PM.  That way, it's ready to
proof by 4 PM and ready to bake by dinner time.

This works with **any beer**, although I'd recommend you'd stick to
light beer.

## Materials

- water, cold (0.25 cups)
- Amstel light (0.25 cups)
- yeast, dry active (0.25 tsp)
- flour, all purpose (2 cups)
- sugar (1 tsp)
- kosher salt (1.5 tsp)

## Procedure

1. Add all ingredients into a bowl.  Mix with a stand mixer and dough
   hook for 30 seconds, or by hand until the dough comes together in a
   sticky ball.
   
2. Cover the bowl tightly in tinfoil.  Set aside in a room temperature
   place.  If you have a drafty house, a turned off oven works well.
   Let the yeast rise for approximately **18 hours**.
   
3. Remove the tinfoil.  Using a rubber spatula, deflate the dough by
   scraping the sides and turning it over onto itself a few times with
   a folding & wiping motion.
   
4. Scrape the sticky dough into a lightly oiled loaf pan.  Tap the pan
   on the counter to remove air bubbles, and gently smoothen the top
   with the spatula.

5. Using a basting brush, lightly brush the top surface of the dough
   with oil.
   
6. Cover with tinfoil and set aside to proof at room temperature for
   approximately **2-3 hours**.

7. Remove foil.  Using a very sharp knife, make a slash down the
   middle of the of the dough surface about a quarter inch deep.  It
   doesn't need to be pretty - this only serves as a weak point to
   control where the cracking happens.
   
8. Bake at **450 F** for **25 minutes**.  When it is cooked through,
   the middle of the dough should sound hollow when flicked, like a
   bongo drum.  For best results, bake with a pan filled with water in
   the oven, and spritz the top of the loaf with cold water 10 minutes
   into baking.
   
9. Remove from the oven to cool completely in the pan.  Serve with
   butter.
