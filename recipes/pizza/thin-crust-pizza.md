The Recker family thin crust pizza has had many iterations.  It may continue to change, but these constants remain: (1) it makes a huge mess in the kitchen and (2) it's delicious.

## Dough

### Materials

- dry active yeast (1 packet)
- water, warm (2 cups)
- kosher salt (2 tsp)
- olive oil (2 tbsp)
- honey (2 tbsp)
- bread flour (760g)

### Procedure

Pour warm water into a large mixing bowl.  Add half the yeast packet and discard the rest[^1].

Add kosher salt.

Add the olive oil, then the honey.  Use the same measuring spoon so that honey slides easily off the surface greased with oil.

Stir the mixture together.

Add a small amount of flour to the bowl.  Use a rubber spatula to stir the mixture until the flour is dissolved.

Continue to stir in small amounts of flour.  When you are about 80% through the measured flour, the mixture will transition from a thick batter to a shaggy dough.

Take a break from adding flour.  Keeping everything in the bowl, use one hand to smash the dough while the other hand turns the bowl in a circle.  Continue kneading, flipping, and rolling the dough - eventually the dough will become stickier.  With a light touch, roll the dough around so it "cleans" flour off the sides of the bowl.

Pour a small amount of flour onto the counter and dump the dough out on top.  Pour the rest of the flour on top of the dough.

Knead the dough by hand.  Use any method you want (there are lots of youtube videos for kneading pizza dough), but just make sure you keep smashing, stretching, and folding the dough.  By the time the dough ball has absorbed all the flour on the table, the dough should spring back to the touch (test this by poking an indent with your finger and watching for how fast the hole springs back).  Keep kneading the dough until it achieves a high level of spring, as this will make it much easier to roll the dough out later.

Pack the dough into a tight ball, then place it back in the mixing bowl.  Drizzle it with olive oil, then roll it around the bowl to coat the inside with oil.

Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or tinfoil.  Leave in a warm place to bulk rise for 3 hours.

[^1]: A 3 hour bulk rise yields great flavor, but if you are short on time, you can achieve a pretty decent dough in 1 hour.  Just use the entire yeast packet and leave the dough some place warm.

## Sauce

### Materials

- olive oil (3 tbsp, or enough to cover bottom of pan)
- shallots, diced (3-4)
- kosher salt
- tomato paste (1 tbsp)
- oregano (1 tbsp)
- san marzano tomatoes, whole & peeled (1 28 oz can)

### Procedure

1. Add olive oil to a small sauce pan over medium low heat.  Add shallots and stir gently with a spoon.

2. Sweat down the shallots.  Add oregano and tomato paste.  Stir and cook for another minute.

3. Use a blender (immersion blender is easiest) to puree the can of tomatoes.  Turn the heat to high and dump the entire can in.  Using the same can, fill 1/4 of the way with water and add to sauce.

4. Bring the heat down and simmer gently while occasionally stirring for 20-30 minutes.  Add salt to taste.

5. Optional: purree the sauce with a blender again and add a whole basil stem while it cools.  Strain the sauce one final time.

## Pizza

### Materials

Obviously, the dough and the sauce made from the previous sections are required too.

- corn meal (excess)
- cheese, grated (to taste)

### Procedure

1. Place a 14 in. pizza stone on the oven rack.  Pre-heat the oven to 500F.

2. Move a single proofed dough ball to a lightly floured counter top.  Roll out smooth with a rolling pin.  If the dough fights back, just leave it on the counter under oiled plastic for a few minutes.

3. Transfer the flat dough to a pizza peel coated in corn meal.  Using a fork, stab the top of the pizza everywhere on the surface (this prevents giant bubbles from forming).

4. Give the flat dough a quick shake to ensure it's not sticking to the peel.  Using a ladel, cover the dough in a thin layer of red sauce.

5. Give the pizza another quick shake to ensure it's not sticking to the peel.  Cover lightly with shredded cheese.

6. Now the tricky part.  With a quick motion, slide the pizza off the peel and onto the pizza stone.  Let the pizza cook for ten minutes.

7. Take the pizza out and let it cool before slicing.
