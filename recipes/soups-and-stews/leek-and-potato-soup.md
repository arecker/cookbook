## Materials

- butter (2 tbsp)
- leeks (3)
- russet potatoes (3)
- garlic (2 cloves)
- chicken stock (32 oz)
- heavy whipping cream (1/4 cup)
- salt
- white pepper

## Procedure

1. Slice white part of leeks.  Add to a large mixing bowl with cold
   water and shake the dirt off with your hands, allowing it to sink
   to the bottom.  Scoop leeks out of bowl and onto a plate.
2. Melt butter in the bottom of a dutch oven.  Once the butter is
   hissing, add leaks and mix.  Allow leeks to soften for five
   minutes.
3. Add minced garlic and mix.  Allow to cook for another minute.
4. Peel and cut the potatoes into small pieces.  Add to the pot, and
   add chicken stock until the potatoes are just covered.
5. Simmer the mixture covered until the potatoes are softened and
   pierce easily at the end of a fork (est. 20 minutes).
6. Blend the mixture throughly.  Add heavy whipping cream until
   desired consistency.
7. Season with salt, white pepper, and cyan pepper to taste.  Serve
   with sprinkled cheese and submerged toasted bread.
