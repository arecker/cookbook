# Alex's Chili

Author: Alex Recker

Alex's Chili is a quick and easy way to please your guests.  It only takes 5 days to prepare.  This recipe makes about 2 gallons of chili, which is plenty for up to 30 people.  It's also gluten free (up until the point you drown a fat piece of cornbread in the bowl).

## Materials

- [brown stock](./brown-stock.md) (1 gallon)
- chorizo (1.5-2 lbs)
- boneless beef ribs (4-4.5 lbs)[^1]

## Procedure

### Smoking the Meat

Rinse the beef ribs and pat dry.  You may optionally dust them with adobo seasoning, gochugaru, bbq rub, or any seasoning of your choice (or you can leave them plain).  Do not rinse nor season the chorizo (the Bible says it is a sin to mess with chorizo).

Prepare the smoker.  Once it is producing clean smoke consistently between 220-270F, add the meat.  The beef can be closer to the heat, but the chorizo should receive VIP treatment.  If possible, leave a small gap between all the pieces of meat to encourage the formation of delicious meat bark.

[^1]: the term "boneless beef ribs" may be misleading, the ones I get are only $3-6 per lb.  This may be the less fatty back ribs, or possibly even just a lean piece of sirloin cut into strips.  I wouldn't recommend a premium piece of meat, like actual bone-in beef ribs.  If you can't find "boneless beef ribs", I would just get a big piece of sirloin or chuck roast and cut it into 10-12 small portions.
