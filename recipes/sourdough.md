## Materials

- sourdough starter (0.25 cup)
- water, cold (1 cup)
- salt, kosher (1.5 tsp)
- bread flour (2.5 cups)

## Procedure

1. Add sourdough starter and water to a mixing bowl.  Use the water to
   rinse the measuring cup clean to ensure you get all the starter in
   the bowl.

2. Add salt and flour all at once.

3. Using a mixer, mix with a dough hook on low until the dough comes
   together.  It should be sticky enough to pull the dough off the
   sides of the bowl.

4. Cover the bowl with a towel and set aside for 6 hours.  During this
   time, pull and fold the dough over itself about ten times once
   every hour.

5. Scoop the dough onto a clean table.  Sprinkle the top of the dough
   ball with flour.  Using a circular motion from the bottom, pinch
   and spin the dough into a tight ball.

6. Move the dough ball to a wooden, well floured banneton and cover
   with a dry towel.  Leave the covered banneton in the fridge
   overnight.

7. The next morning, take the banneton out of the fridge and place it
   in a warm place.  Let the dough warm up and rise until it passes
   the "poke test" - that is, if you poke the dough, it should spring
   back slowly but not completely fill the impression.

8. Transfer from the banneton to a square silpat.  Score the dough and
   lower into a cold dutch oven.

8. Spray the top of the dough and sides of the dough oven with water.
   Cover the dutch oven and bake with the lid on for 20 minutes.

9. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 25 minutes.

10. Remove from the oven and transfer to a rack.  Allow the loaf to
    cool completely before cutting.
