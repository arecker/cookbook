## Pizza

### Materials

- bread crumbs (0.75 cups)
- pecorino romano (1 cup, finely grated)
- mozzarella (3 oz, shredded)
- provolone (3 oz, shredded)
- olive oil (excess)

### Procedure

1. Preheat an oven to 400F.
2. Liberally coat a baking pan with olive oil (about 3 TBSP).  After
   dipping your hands in oil (or an implement), carefully work the
   sticky dough out of the bowl, dumping it onto the baking pan.
3. Carefully stretch and tug the dough until it covers the baking pan.
   If it is springy, give it a few minutes to rest in between
   attempts.  Eventually the dough's weight will distribute itself
   evenly across the pan.
4. Evenly spread the sauce over the dough, stopping about an inch from
   the edge of the pan on all
5. Evenly cover the sauce in shredded mozzarella and provolone.
6. Combine the breadcrumbs with finely grated pecorino.  Add the
   leftover oil from the anchovies and combine with a fork.  Keep
   adding additional olive oil until the breadcrumbs are moistened.
7. Evenly cover the top of the cheese with the breadcrumb mixture.
8. Bake pizza uncovered on the middle rack for 30 minutes or until
   golden brown.  Transfer to a cooling rake to avoid getting the
   crust soggy.
