# Turkey

Author: Alex Recker

## Materials

- roasting pan with ham rack
- baking sheets with wire racks (2)
- turkey, completely thawed and dried
- kosher salt and pepper, mixed (excess)
- [herb butter](./herb-butter.md), room temperature (1 cup)

## Procedure

### Prepping

1. Using a boning knife, separate the wings and thigh quarters from the turkey.  Rinse the parts under cold water and dry.  Set these aside on top of baking sheet with wire racks, the 2 thighs quarters on one sheet and the 2 wings on the second sheet.

2. Gently bend the lower part of the back away from the front of the bird.  Use a boning knife to finish the cut.  Set aside the lower back.

3. Rinse the breast and cage of the bird under cold water and dry.  Use the salt and pepper mixture to season the inside of the cavity and place on the ham rack.

4. Loosen the skin covering the breast.  Fill the space under the skin with herb butter and smooth it out over the chest like a breastplate.

5. Use the salt and pepper mixture to season the outside of the breast.

6. Use the salt and pepper mixture to season both sides of the wings and leg quarters.

7. **Optional**: use a cleaver to cut the neck into chunks.  Use a boning knife to remove the "oyster" meat from the lower back of the turkey.  Set all these aside to make turkey jous for the gravy.

8. Place the roasting dish and the two baking sheets in the fridge uncovered for 24-48 hours.

**Notes**

The neck and back meat can be seared later to enhance the stock used to make the gravy.

This is the back piece I remove from the breast/cage of the bird.  You can keep it to make stock or soups, but I don't like to use seasoned meat in stocks (by now I have [brined](./turkey-brine.md) my turkey) so I just remove some of the back meat and throw it away.
