# Turkey Jous

A _jous_ is just a small portion of brown stock enhanced with some seared meat, spirits, and other flavors.  It makes a great starting point for [gravy](./gravy.md).

## Materials

- neutral oil (1 tsp)
- [turkey stock](./turkey-stock.md) (2 quarts)
- turkey trimmings (e.g. chopped neck pieces, drumstick meat, back meat, wing tips) (2 cups)
- shallots, chopped (2)
- carrots, chopped (1)
- celery, chopped (2)
- peppercorns (1 tbsp)
- bay leaf (1)
- tomato paste (1 tbsp)
- brandy (1 shot)
- herb bouquet (optional)

## Procedure

1. Add oil to  a small saucepan and place over medium high high heat.

2. When the pan is hot enough to sear the meat (test it by touching a piece to the surface), place all the meat evenly around the bottom of the pan.

3. Let the meat color and stick to the pan without burning.  Gently flip each piece to get as much coloring as you can.

4. Remove the meat and set aside.  Add all the vegetables to the pan and swirl for 3-5 minutes (do not fry them, just introduce them).

5. Add all the meat back to the pan and add tomato paste.  Continue to swirl for 3-5 minutes.

6. Set the heat to high.  Add the brandy and let it evaporate.  Add a splash of cold water and use a spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan.  Turn the heat off.

7. Warm up the stock.  Add the stock to the pan and bring to a gentle simmer.  Add the peppercorns, bay leaf, and herb bouquet if you have one.  Simmer with the lid on for 1-2 hours.

8. Turn off the heat.  Pour the liquid through a metal strainer. into a container.

9. Line the metal strainer with a clean paper towel.  Pour the liquid through the paper towel into a new container to catch the grit and fat.

10. Top off the container until you have 2 quarts of liquid.  Place the finished jous in the fridge or freezer until needed.
