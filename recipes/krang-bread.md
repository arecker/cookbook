Krang Bread is a simple, no fuss, versatile sourdough.  It's makes as
good of a sandwich, as it does french toast, as it does regular toast,
and at the end of the day it still tastes great with just a swipe of
butter.

## Materials

- [krang][^1] (113 g)
- water, cold (548 g)
- kosher salt (13 g)
- bread flour[^2] (652 g)

[^1]: Or any 100% flour weight sourdough starter
[^2]: Can also cut with any amount of wheat flour by weight.

## Procedure

1. Combine water and starter in a large container.  Use your hands to
   break up the starter until it dissolves completely in the water.

2. Add the flour.  Mix with your hands until all the flour is wet.
   Cover and set aside to rest for 30-45 minutes.

3. Remove the lid and add the salt.  Fold the dough.  There are plenty
   of videos on how to fold dough, so watch a few and pick your
   favorite, they're all good.

4. Fold the dough every 30 minutes for the next few hours.  After
   about 3-4 hours, it will become soft, smooth, shiny, and it won't
   stick as much.

5. Wet your finger tips.  Gently dislodge the dough from the
   container, working around the outside with your hands held flat
   like flippers.  Dump the dough out onto a clean counter.

6. With wet hands, work around the outside of the dough, gently
   stretching it out flat like a canopy.  Gently press out the air
   bubbles.

7. Fold each corner into the center and ball it up into a big bubble.
   Quickly flip it upside down and set it on a dry part of the
   counter.  Allow to rest for twenty minutes.

8. Take note of how the dough looks after bench rest.  It should be
   flatter, but the outsides should still be round like a bubble.  If
   they taper, that means you didn't kneed your dough enough.

9. With wet hands, work your way underneath the outsides until you can
   quickly flip it upside down on another part of the counter.  Try
   not to break the surface of the dough.  Roll the dough into a log
   and transfer it onto a piece of parchment paper.  In one swift
   motion, drop the parchment paper and dough into a 10x5 pan.  Cover
   tightly in tinfoil and leave in the fridge over night.

10. Remove pan from fridge.  Leave at room temperature until the dough
    reaches just below the top of the pan.  The top should be bubbly
    and very runny.  If possible, leave it in a warm spot or in a
    slightly warmed oven.  Should take 2 hours.

11. Bake at 450F for 40 minutes, uncovered.  Immediately remove from
    pan and leave to cool on a rack.
