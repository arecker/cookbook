Krang Bread is a simple, no fuss, versatile sourdough.  It's makes as
good of a sandwich, as it does french toast, as it does regular toast,
and at the end of the day it still tastes great with just a swipe of
butter.

## Materials

- [krang][^1] (113 g)
- water, cold (548 g)
- kosher salt (13 g)
- bread flour[^2] (652 g)

[^1]: Or any 100% flour weight sourdough starter
[^2]: Can also cut with any amount of wheat flour by weight.

## Procedure

1. Combine all ingredients in a large, wide, flat bottomed container.
   Use your hands to incorporate until all the flour is mixed and it
   comes together in a shaggy dough, but don't knead.

2. Cover the container and leave to rest for 45 minutes.

3. Remove the lid and fold the dough.  With wet hands, stretch the
   dough as far as it will go without breaking, pulling it over the
   top and to the other side.  Go top to bottom, bottom to top, left
   to right, right to left, then flip the dough over like a pillow.
   Flatten at the bottom of the container, then cover to rest for
   another 30 minutes. If the dough is still too loose to be handled,
   just do your best to stretch it out wherever possible.

4. Fold the dough every 30 minutes for the next few hours.  After
   about 4 hours, it will become soft, smooth, shiny, and it won't
   stick as much.  Remove from the bowl and fold into a log on a moist
   counter, and allow it to rest for 15 minutes.

6. With wet hands, roll the dough into a log and drop it into a 10x5
   in. pan lined with parchment paper.  Using wet fingers, tuck the
   sides of the dough down to the bottom of the pan.  Cover tightly in
   foil and leave in the fridge overnight.

7. Remove pan from fridge.  Leave at room temperature until the dough
   reaches just below the top of the pan.  The top should be bubbly
   and very runny.  If possible, leave it in a warm spot or in a
   slightly warmed oven.  Should take 2 hours.

8. Bake at 450F for 40 minutes, uncovered.  Immediately remove from
   pan and leave to cool on a rack.
